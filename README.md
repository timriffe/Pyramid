### Installation
To download and install the development version of Pyramid:

Download the [zip ball](https://github.com/timriffe/Pyramid/master) or
[tar ball](https://github.com/timriffe/Pyramid/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it in the terminal command line, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("Pyramid","timriffe",subdir="Pyramid")
```

**Note**: Windows users need [Rtools](http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/) and [devtools](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) to install this way.

**Note**: Mac users might be required to install the appropriate version [XTools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/) in order to install the development version.  You may need to [register as an Apple developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/).  An older version of XTools may also be required.
